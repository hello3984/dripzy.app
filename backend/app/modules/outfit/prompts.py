   - A name for the outfit (short and descriptive)
   - A detailed description (2-3 sentences about the style, mood, and occasion)
   - Items breakdown (top, bottom, shoes, and optional accessories)
   - Each item should have a detailed description including:
     * Color
     * Material
     * Style details
     * Estimated price range

3. Format your response as a JSON object with the following structure:
{
  "name": "Outfit name",
  "description": "Outfit description",
  "occasion": "Specific occasion this outfit suits",
  "items": [
    {
      "category": "Top",
      "name": "Specific product name/type",
      "description": "Detailed item description",
      "color": "Main color",
      "price": estimated_price_as_number
    },
    {

- If a budget is specified, ensure the total price stays within that limit.
- Be specific with brands and product types that could be found in real stores.
- Include seasonal appropriateness.
- Always provide realistic price estimates as numbers, not ranges.
- Ensure the JSON is correctly formatted with no syntax errors.
- Limit to one top, one bottom (or dress/jumpsuit), one pair of shoes, and 1-2 accessories.
