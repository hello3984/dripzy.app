Default Avatar Image

This is a placeholder for a default avatar image.
In a real implementation, this would be an actual .jpg, .png or .webp file.

The application will need the following image files:
1. avatar-example.jpg - An example of what an avatar might look like
2. default-avatar.jpg - A default avatar to use when no photo is uploaded

These should be professionally designed and appropriate for the application's audience.
